# Real_Time_Concat_Index

This is a continuation of the concatenative synth that is used in my larger performance patch. In my last patch, I use a 5-minute circular buffer that I can pull 30 second, 1 minute, or 3-minute windows of audio out of, analyze, fit to a kdtree, and then playback using several different tools. This works well for me and is a powerful performance tool. However, this whole process must be started by the performer. My favorite thing about circular buffers is, like traditional instruments, they function in a reactionary fashion. A circular buffer is always recording and will always have a continuous past. So, I set out to apply this same concept to corpus generation. Every 100ms, the analysis chain looks at the previous 100ms of incoming audio and add its analysis data to a indexing dataset. That 100ms grain is then moved to a new buffer, and the indexed dataset is refit to the kdtree. This whole process is limited to 100 grains before it will overwrite the old grains in both the dataset and buffer.
